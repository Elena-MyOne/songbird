Welcome to the game Songbird where you should guess a bird by its sound.

Rules are pretty easy:

Each time you guess right from the first try you get 5 points. If the first guess is wrong every next try will cost you 1 point. So if the right try is only 6th you get 0 points.

All points will be added up.

Good luck!
